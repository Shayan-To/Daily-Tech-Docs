Note: Do not enable 3D acceleration.
Note: Make sure that the architecture is selected correctly in Settings>General>Basic>Version.

Install `build-essential` package from the package manager and then the guest additions (Devices -> Guest Additions CD Image).

If from a terminal, mount the cd-rom by `sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom` and then do `sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`.

For shared folders, add your user to `vboxsf` group by `sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf shayan`.

After installing OpenSSH (server and client), forward port 22 of the host to port 22 of the guest and ssh to `shayan@localhost`. (from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145997/trying-to-ssh-to-local-vm-ubuntu-with-putty)

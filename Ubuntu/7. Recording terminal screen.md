In the name of God

For recording the terminal screen, use `script`.

The line below will run `byobu` and record the whole session to the file `$1` and timings to the file `$1.tim`.

```bash
script -c byobu -t$1.tim $1
```

For recording the `ssh` sessions, we can run the line above on the server. (Also we should watch and when `byobu` is closed we should run the recording again)

Another way is to simply pipe to `tee`, like `ssh user@sever | tee $1`. The problem of this is that it does not store timings. For solving that, we can use this trick:

```bash
mkfifo fifotmp
nohup script -c 'cat fifotmp' -t$1.tim $1 > /dev/null
ssh user@server | tee fifotmp
rm fifotmp
```

And of course, `script -c 'ssh user@server' -t$1.tim $1` is possible.

I have written a simple C++ program to replay the recording file. Usage: `scriptout $1 $1.tim [speed_multiplier]`.

In the name of God.

From https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/113754/allow-user1-to-su-user2-without-password.

Add the following lines underneath the `pam_rootok.so` line in your `/etc/pam.d/su`:

    auth  [success=ignore default=1] pam_succeed_if.so user = martin-test
    auth  sufficient                 pam_succeed_if.so use_uid user = martin

These lines perform checks using the [`pam_succeed_if.so`][1] module. See also the [Linux-PAM configuration file syntax][2] to learn more about the `auth` lines.

 - The first line checks whether the *target user* is `martin-test`. If it is nothing happens (`success=ignore`) and we can continue on the next line to check the *current user*. If it is not, the next line will be skipped (`default=1`) and we can continue on subsequent lines with the usual authentication steps.
 - The second line checks whether the current user is `martin` or not, if it is then the system considers the authentication process as successful and returns (`sufficient`), if it is not, nothing happens and we continue on subsequent lines with the usual authentication steps.

You can also restrict `su` to a group, here the group `allowedpeople` can `su` without a password:

    auth sufficient pam_succeed_if.so use_uid user ingroup allowedpeople

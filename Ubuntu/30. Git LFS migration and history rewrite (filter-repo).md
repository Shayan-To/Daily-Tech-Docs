- Analyze your binary files:

  - This gives you the list of all binary files:

    ```sh
    diff <(git grep -Ic '') <(git grep -c '') | grep '^>' | cut -d : -f 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2-
    ```

    - `git grep -c ''` gets a list of all files with their line counts, the `-I` skips the binary files. ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30689384/find-all-binary-files-in-git-head))

  - Output to file, load into powershell, pipe to `Get-Item`, and ` | % Extension | Sort -Unique`.

    - More advanced version:

      ```ps1
      $Items = GC binary-files | Get-Item
      $Items | % Extension | sort -Unique `
        | % {
            New-Object PsObject -Property @{
                ext = $_
                size = $Items | ? Extension -eq $_ | % Length `
                    | measure -Sum | % Sum `
                    | % { [math]::Round($_ / 1024, 1) }
            }
        } `
        | sort size -Descending
      ```

  - Review and build a `.gitattributes` file.

- Make a clone of the repo:

  ```sh
  git clone --reference ./my-repo --dissociate https://git/my-repo my-repo-mig-1
  ```

  - Add `-c core.longpaths=true` in from of `clone` to enable long paths if needed.

- Add the `.gitattributes` file to the root commit of the repo.

  - ([Source](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/d8e858aeca643284e3a2f8a45e1476ec4d6f2920/contrib/filter-repo-demos/insert-beginning))

  - Copy the file over to the repo (doesn't matter what commit you're on).

  - Create a blob and get the hash:

    ```sh
    hash=@(git hash-object -w .gitignore) ; echo $hash
    ```

  - Add the file to the first commit(s):

    ```sh
    git filter-repo --commit-callback "# this is python!
        import git_filter_repo as fr
        # This makes sure that the file is identical in all commits.
        commit.file_changes = [fc for fc in commit.file_changes
                               if fc.filename != b'.gitattributes']
        if len(commit.parents) == 0:
            # Use this for FileChange class if import was not possible.
            #FileChange = commit.file_changes[0].__class__
            commit.file_changes.append(
                fr.FileChange(b'M', b'.gitattributes', b'$hash', b'100644')
                #  type  filename           blob_id   mode
            )
    "
    ```

    - There is more info on `git filter-repo --help`, at the final part of **CALLBACKS** section.

- Remove any unwanted files:

  ```sh
  git filter-repo --invert-paths --path-regex '\.(db|g?zip)'
  ```

  - See **EXAMPLES** section of `git filter-repo --help`.

- Migrate to `git lfs`:

  ```sh
  git lfs migrate import --everything --fixup
  ```

  - `--everything` migrates all the commits, not only the current branch.

  - `--fixup` fixes commits according to the `.gitattributes` file available at the commit.

  - See `git lfs help migrate` or [online man page](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate.1.ronn) (same thing).

- Do a final rewrite on the repo:

  ```sh
  git filter-repo --force
  ```

  - I don't know whether this is necessary.

    - This is most likely unnecessary, but also harmless.

  - `filter-repo` makes replace-refs (made by `git replace`) permanent.

  - Search for `git replace` and `git-replace` on `git filter-repo --help` and, obviously, see `git replace --help`.

- Clean up the stupid extra refs created by `filter-repo` to indicate the replacement commits.

  - Open `.git/packed-refs` in an editor and delete the lines.
  - This will only clean up the git history and is unnecessary. Also probably dangerous, as you might loose the data of original commit hashes (haven't checked how useful the data actually is, as there are multiple migration steps with different tools).

- Push everything.

  - Add back `origin` (the remotes are automatically removed by `filter-repo`):

    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://git/my-repo
    ```

  - Unprotect branches and tags on the server.

  - Push all the branches:

    ```sh
    git push -f origin --all
    ```

  - Push all the tags:

    ```sh
    git push -f origin --tags
    ```

- Done!

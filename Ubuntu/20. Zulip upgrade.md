# Updating

-  Do `wajig update` and `wajig upgrade`.
-  Check that no configuration file will be overwritten by the upgrade by running `scripts/zulip-puppet-apply` (without `-f`).
   -  The script is located at `/home/zulip/deployments/current`.
-  Go to `~` (`cd /root`).
-  Take down the main nginx server (as it will cause conflicts on ports 80 and 443) by `/opt/nginx-sa/sbin/nginx -s quit` or `service nginx-sa stop`.
-  Download the release from <https://www.zulip.org/dist/releases/>.
-  Run this: `sudo /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip zulip-server-VERSION.tar.gz`

# Rolling back

-  Go to `/home/zulip/deployments`.
-  Find the directory of the last install by running `ls -l` and looking at the symbolic links and the dates (folder names).
-  Run `scripts/restart-server` from the deployment directory (with `su zulip -c` at the beginning).

# After upgrade

-  `service nginx stop‚Äç`
-  `cd /etc/nginx/sites-available`
-  `./set-zulip-ports.sh new`
-  `cd /home/zulip/prod-static`
-  `./add_to_app.sh`
-  `service nginx start`
-  `service nginx-sa start`

# Notes

-  Upgrade log is written to `/var/log/zulip/upgrade.log`.
-  Check `/var/log/zulip/errors.log` after the upgrade to make sure the users are not experiencing issues.

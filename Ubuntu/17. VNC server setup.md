In the name of God

From https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-16-04 and https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/remote-desktop/install-vnc-on-ubuntu-16-04#connect-to-vnc-from-your-desktop (mostly first).

-  Install `tightvncserver` or `vnc4server`. (`tightvncserver` is tested)

-  Install `xfce4` and `xfce4-goodies`.

-  Create a user to start the server on that user. ([useradd](Simple tasks\1. useradd.md))

-  Get shell to that user (`su user`).

-  Run `vncserver` so that it creates the configuration files and configs the password.

-  Kill the server by `vncserver -kill :1`.

-  Go to `~/.vnc`.

-  Edit `xstartup` and make it something like this (comment and add):

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
   startxfce4 &
   ```

-  Start the server by `vncserver :1`.

-  Forward the port locally by `ssh -NL localhost:5902:localhost:5901 root@parmyn.org`.

-  Now connect to `localhost:2` by a viewer.

-  If it didn't work, you can open the port 5901 on the server and test the direct connection.

-  Note: The `:#` number is the 'display port `#`' and is bound to the TCP port `5900 + #`.

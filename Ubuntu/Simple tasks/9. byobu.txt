In the name of God

From the man of byobu.

Edit `~/.byobu/windows.tmux` to configure the initial state that byobu start to.
Use `new-session bash` at the beginning, and then some lines of `new-window -n title command`.
You can find the docs and switches in the man of tmux.

Use `-L name` to create a named session.
`byobu -L shayan new`
`byobu -L shayan attach`

Use this to open windows in the newly created named session:
`byobu -L shayan new ";" new-window -n title sudo -s`

Use `-t` on ssh to give it the argument:
`ssh user@server -p port -t 'byobu -L shayan attach'`

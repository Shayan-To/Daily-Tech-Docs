In the name of God

When doing an interactive rebase, you can put an 'exec' command between the commit lines and it will be executed.

These are some that I ended up using often:

Change the commit author to me:
x git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author

Change the author to someone else:
x git commit --amend --no-edit --author='MohammadAminâ€Œ Raeisi <mohammadaminraeisi@outlook.com>'

Run an unnecessarily complicated build and formatting check: (I ran this on all of the commits to make sure they're all good!)
x git reset --hard && npm i && git reset --hard && npm i && npx tsc -b && npm run pretty-check:all && echo good

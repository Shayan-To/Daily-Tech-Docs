In the name of God

-  `df` shows disk usage for each drive.
-  `du` shows the size of the current directory and all subdirectories.
-  `ncdu` is a very nice interactive version of `du`.
-  `stat` shows a quick summary.
-  Other suggestions:
   -  `du -shx * | sort -rh | head -10`
   -  `du -a /home | sort -rn |head -1`
   -  `find /home/ -type f -printf "%s:%p\n" | sort -t":" -rn| head -1`

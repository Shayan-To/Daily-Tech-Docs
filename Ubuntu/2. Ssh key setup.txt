In the name of God

From https://lani78.com/2008/08/08/generate-a-ssh-key-and-disable-password-authentication-on-ubuntu-server/.

1. Generate keys
ssh-keygen -b 8192
OR
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

2. Add the public key to the server:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh parmyn 'cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

Or:
ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa parmyn

3. Ensure key authentication is enabled. (it usually is, can be skipped!)
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

This has to be 'yes':

PubkeyAuthentication yes

systemctl restart sshd.service

4. Disconnect and reconnect. No password should be requested.

5. Disable password authentication
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

These have to be 'no':

PaswordAuthentication no
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
UsePAM no

systemctl restart sshd.service

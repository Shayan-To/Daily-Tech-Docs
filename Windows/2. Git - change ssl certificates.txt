In the name of God

From https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/phkelley/2014/01/20/adding-a-corporate-or-self-signed-certificate-authority-to-git-exes-store/.

1. Get the path of the original cert file by `git config http.sslCAInfo`.

2. Copy that file to your profile directory by `cp /d/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt ~`.

3. Set the cert file to be used by git by `git config --global http.sslCAInfo /c/Users/Shayan/ca-bundle.crt`.

4. Edit the cert file and add your cert to its end. You can also add a comment before like this (at least):

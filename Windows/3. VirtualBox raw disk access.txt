0. See the number of the disk in disk management.

1. Open an elevated cmd to `D:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox`.

2. Run `VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename "D:\Temp\RawDisk1.vmdk" -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive1`.

   - If you only want a selection of the partitions, Run `žVBoxManage internalcommands listpartitions -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive1` to see the partition list, and add `-partitions 6,7` to the command above.

3. Run VirtualBox as administrator (it needs raw access to hard disk, so has to be elevated) and create a VM having the disk.

4. File, Media Manager, and create a copy of the disk (VHD is more universal).
